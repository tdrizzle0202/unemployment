These benefit payments help job seekers focus on the path to reemployment and lessen the negative impact of unemployment on the economy. Benefits are not available to all workers. For example, workers who were fired from their job for misconduct cannot receive UI benefits. Funding for the UI Program The Colorado UI program is funded through premiums paid by employers. No money is deducted from your paycheck to pay for UI benefits.",

Reporting that you looked for work when you did not make valid work search efforts. Someone steals your identity and files a claim on your behalf. How to Avoid Committing Fraud Always tell the truth. If you intentionally make false statements or hide information to gain or maintain UI benefits, you are committing fraud. Report all hours worked and earnings if you work while requesting payment of unemployment benefits. Contact employers for new work and keep accurate records of your efforts. Tell us about any job you are offered but decide to turn down. Tell us right away when you stop working or separate from a job. When you request benefit payments, tell us any time you are unable and/or unavailable to work (for example, if you are ill or injured, out of the area, on vacation, incarcerated, etc.). Do not make false statements or be dishonest in order to receive or increase benefits. Do not use another person’s identity (e.g. name, social security number, address) to work or to file for unemployment benefits. Do not help someone to fraudulently file a UI claim or request payments.

    "text": "Alongside the rise in unemployment insurance claims associated with COVID-19, states saw a corresponding rise in unemployment fraud, identity theft, phishing attacks, hijacked claims, and other scams targeting unemployment claimants. Below, you’ll find tips on how to protect yourself, as well as options to report suspected fraud, identity theft, or a compromised MyUI+ account. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself against attempts to compromise your MyUI+ account and unemployment claim: Be careful about requests by phone, text, or email to share personally identifiable information such as your Social Security number, bank account numbers, PIN numbers, or account passwords. Scammers try to obtain personal information in order to file fraudulent claims or hijack your existing claim. Avoid clicking links in emails and text messages.

If you have filed an unemployment claim, verify that your address, phone number, email, and payment",
