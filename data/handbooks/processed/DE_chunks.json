Unlike public welfare, UI is an insurance program and proving a need for assistance is not a prerequisite to its payment. UI is similar to other forms of insurance. In all states, employers pay a tax to cover their workers against involuntary unemployment. Most employers are required to pay this tax. When you work for such an employer, you are in “covered employment” and your wages are “covered wages.” Your unemployment insurance benefit is based upon these wages. Like any other insurance, UI has certain requirements which must be met if you are to receive benefit payments. All unemployment transactions are time sensitive. These individual and monetary requirements are established by statutes and regulations and are administered by the Division.\nThis Handbook is designed to explain your rights and responsibilities under the Delaware Unemployment Compensation Law. Its purpose is to provide you with information and should not be considered to have the force of law.\nThis Handbook should answer many of the questions you may have regarding filing a claim for benefits. However, if you have questions not covered in these pages, please call the nearest Unemployment Insurance Local Office. Telephone numbers for the local offices are listed on the front cover.",
