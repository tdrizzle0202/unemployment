    "content": "Unemployment insurance is a state-operated insurance program designed to partially compensate you for loss of wages when you are out of work. As with fire, accident, health and other types of insurance, it is for an emergency: when you are temporarily or permanently out of a job or if you work less than full-time due to lack of work.\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS 4\nThe program ensures that, if you meet the eligibility requirements of the law, you will have some income while you are looking for a job, up to a maximum of 26 full weeks in a one-year period. However, unemployment insurance cannot and does not protect you against wage losses while you are absent from work due to illness or while you are idle by choice.\nUnemployment insurance should not be confused with Social Security, which is a federal program to protect you and your dependents against loss of earnings upon retirement, permanent disability or death. You pay for Social Security partially through payroll deductions; you do not pay any part of your wages, either directly or through payroll deductions, for unemployment insurance in Illinois. Unemployment insurance benefits are funded by tax dollars collected from Illinois employers.\nBecause employers pay the cost of unemployment insurance (the amount that they pay varies depending on the number of claims charged to their experience), employers have the right to contest claims that they believe are not legitimate.",

To qualify for benefits, you must meet eligibility requirements. If you do, benefits will be paid to you as a matter of right. Benefits are not based on need; they are not charity or welfare.\nIn Illinois, the unemployment insurance program is administered by IDES; services are provided to the public via the Internet and at IDES offices throughout the state.\nIf you become unemployed, you may file a claim online at IDES.Illinois.gov or at an IDES office. Office locations can be found online or by calling IDES Claimant Services.\nFile your claim during the first week after you have become unemployed or as soon thereafter as possible.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 amended the law to make unemployment insurance benefits taxable if you are required to file a state or federal tax return. You may elect to have federal and/or State of Illinois income taxes deducted and withheld from your unemployment insurance benefit payments. Deductions are made at predetermined levels: 10% for federal income tax and 4.95% for state income tax. If you do not elect to have federal and/or State of Illinois income taxes deducted and withheld from your unemployment insurance benefit payments, you may be required to make estimated tax payments using Internal Revenue Service Form 1040ES and the Illinois Department of Revenue form, IL 1040ES. IDES will provide you with IRS Form 1099-G, a statement of benefits paid to you at the end of each calendar year.",
