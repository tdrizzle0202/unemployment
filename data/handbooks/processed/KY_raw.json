Site Enhancements and Electronic 2019 Contribution Rates are set based on Rate Schedule A. This is the lowest rate schedule since 2003. Reporting 2019 Contribution Rates will be reduced by an additional 0.075% for the SCUF assessment. Your Contribution Rate Notice should display a “Ul Rate based on your calculated Reserve Ratio, an “Adjusted Ul Rate” from the SCUF reduction, and a “SCUF Rate\" that is set at 0.075%. Please utilize the Adjusted Ul Rate and the SCUF Rate when calculating the total amount due on your quarterly report filings. 2019 Taxable Wage Base per worker will increase by $300 to $10,500 per worker. Please be sure to make this adjustment prior to filing your 1st quarter 2019 report during April 2019. Kentucky employers are eligible to claim the full EUTA credit of 5.40% when filing your 2018 IRS 940 Forms in January 2019. This will reduce your FUTA contribution rate to 0.60% (6.00% - 5.40%). The FUTA taxable wage base remains at $7.000 per worker. Important Notice Regarding Contribution Rates During the 2018 Legislation Session, the General Assembly enacted the Service Capacity Upgrade Fund (SCUF), through HB 487, Section 139. Per KRS 341.243, all contribution rates beginning with the 3rd quarter of 2018 shall be reduced by 0.075%, in order to implement SCUF. There is no increase or decrease in the total amount of tax you will pay. This reduction will divert 0.075% of the contributions that would have been applied to your employer reserve account, and apply to SCUF. In addition, you will not be able to claim SCUF payments on your Federal Unemployment Tax filings.

It is extremely safe and easy, and as noted in the previous section, it is required for employers with ten or more workers. One great improvement is confirmation numbers that are provided to you when filing electronic reports and payments, allowing you to reference those transactions should you need to contact us. Electronic filing and payments also guarantee that the receipt date is the submission date, eliminating the penalty and interest that can be caused by mailing in paper reports and checks, should they be delayed or lost.",

This is the lowest rate schedule since 2003. Site Enhancements and Electronic Raporting 2019 Contribution Rates will be reduced by an additional 0.075% for the SCUF assessment. Your Contribution Rate Notice should display a “Ul Rate™ based on your calculated Reserve Ratio, an “Adjusted Ul Rate” from the SCUF reduction, and a “SCUF Rate\" that is set at 0.075%.

    "text": "Looking at the rate schedule, you will notice that there are six different columns of rates corresponding to the reserve ratio brackets in the first column on the left, with the “Trust Fund Adequacy” rates being the lowest and schedule “E” being the highest. The rate schedule in effect in any given year is based on the balance in Kentucky’s Unemployment Trust Fund by September 30th of the preceding calendar year. For example, if the Trust Fund has a balance of at least $350 million on September 30th, but less than $500 million, then rate schedule “B” would be in effect for the following calendar year. This means that high unemployment costs, which reduce the fund balance, may cause tax rates to increase even for businesses that did not directly experience benefit charges.",

Failure to send a copy to the other party could result in the referee denying entry of the material or the case being continued to a later date.
