However, at the end of the second quarter a deposit is required because the total undeposited tax is now more than $100 ($60 x 2 = $120). If the total for the first, second and third quarters equaled more than $100 (such as $30 + $40 + $40 = $110) then the deposit would be due. If the tax for the third quarter alone is more than $100, a deposit is required. Tax may be due over several quarters.",
