You must also be willing to accept suitable employment for which you are qualified.\nYou are not eligible to receive benefits for any time you are out of the area on vacation or personal business unless your time away is for job search reasons.\nIt is not necessary to call if you plan to be away from home on weekends or if you are available to immediately accept work.\nB A S I C E L I G I B I L I T Y R E Q U I R E M E N T: S E A R C H F O R W O R K\nYou must actively search for work if you are not returning to the employer who laid you off and/or if you are required to search for work and make job contacts. This is required for each week you wish to receive benefits – including your waiting week. Begin making your job contacts the same week that you apply for benefits. The purpose of a job contact is to become employed.\nAdditional information and “How To” videos explaining the unemployment insurance requirements are available in the Resources – Unemployment for Individuals section on jobsnd.com.\nUnemployment Insurance Claimant Guide",
