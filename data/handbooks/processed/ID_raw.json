    "text": "Unemployment insurance provides financial assistance to workers unemployed through no fault of their own. In Idaho, workers do not pay any part of the cost of unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance benefits are funded through a tax on employers, which is collected by Idaho Department of Labor and placed in a federal trust fund. Money from that fund can be used for unemployment benefits and for no other purpose. Idaho Department of Labor is an equal opportunity employer. Auxiliary aids are available for any of the programs offered and are available upon request. If you feel you have been discriminated against in any agency policy or practice, you may file a complaint with the local office manager or the state’s Equal Opportunity Officer at Idaho Department of Labor, 317 W. Main St., Boise, Idaho, 83735; or the U.S. Department of Labor, Directorate of Civil Rights, 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20210. All complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. The information you and your employer provide to Idaho Department of Labor may be requested and utilized by other government agencies with which we have information disclosure agreements. Precautions will be taken by such agencies to protect the confidentiality of the information. Each claim is subject to review by unemployment insurance claim auditors. This is an in-depth audit covering wages earned during your base period, the circumstances of your separation, your work search and earnings on claim reports. Routine audits of claims are conducted to ensure that the information reported is accurate.",

This is because the phone call goes over the network of the company through which the calling card was purchased, and sometimes that system uses the # key to denote end of call, start of another call and other options. So, when you depress the # key after entering wages, the calling card network intercepts this signal first and disconnects the Tel-A-Claim call in progress. Before purchasing a calling card for use with Tel-A-Claim, please check with the company to make sure that the # key will work as expected during a Tel-A-Claim call.

But, I found out that was not the way to go. Besides getting caught, they took me to court. So, it ended up that I had to pay the money back plus I had a pretty good size fine to pay and I ended up having to write this embarrassing letter to the newspaper. So what I have to say is and what I have learned is that they keep things on record, and if you think you can get away with it, think twice because sooner or later, they will get you.",
