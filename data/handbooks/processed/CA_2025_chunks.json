The UI program provides financial benefits for workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own, are able to, available for, and actively seeking work as instructed. Eligibility for receiving benefits is set by law. The EDD administers these laws. You can find California’s UI eligibility requirements in the Unemployment Insurance Code. In California, no deduction is made from the worker’s wages to finance UI benefits. It is paid entirely by the employers. Your claim is subject to periodic quality control and benefit audit reviews. There are severe administrative and/or criminal penalties imposed on individuals found guilty of UI fraud. Claimants reporting false information to obtain UI benefits may be subject to those penalties.\n\nDE 1275A Rev. 49 (2-12) (INTERNET) Page 1 of 43",

Claim Beginning Date: Your claim begins on the Sunday of the week in which you filed your claim. It is not based on the date you became unemployed. DE 429Z Rev. 5 (3-12) CU\n• 2. Claim Ending Date: This is the date your claim year ends. This date is 52 weeks from the claim beginning date. Benefits remaining on this claim cannot be paid for weeks claimed after the claim ending date. A new claim must be filed if you are still unemployed or partially unemployed after the claim ending date.\n• 3. Maximum Benefit Amount: The amount shown is your maximum UI award for this claim. The maximum award is 26 times the weekly benefit\nCU\nPage 4 of 43\n• amount or one-half of the total base period wages, whichever is less (see item 5, for an explanation of the term base period). When you have received your maximum award, no further benefits are payable. You cannot file another California UI claim until your current claim year ends.\n• 4. Weekly Benefit Amount: This is the amount of your weekly benefit. It is the amount you will receive each week if you meet all eligibility requirements (see item 6 for more information). If you work part time and earn more than $25, but less than $100 in a week, your weekly benefit amount will be reduced by your earnings that are more than $25. In that case, the portion of the weekly benefit amount that you do not receive remains in your claim for future use until your benefit year ends. If your weekly earnings are $101 or more, the first 25 percent does not count. The amount of earnings remaining is subtracted from your weekly benefit amount and you are paid the difference, if any.",

A claim is invalid when there are not enough earnings to establish a claim or when there was a prior claim and the work and earnings requirement to have a later claim have not been met (see item 9). NOTE: Under California law and federal law, wages that have already been used to determine the amount of UI benefits payable on a claim cannot be used again in the future to file another UI claim. 6.

School Employee Wage: During a school recess you may not be able to receive benefits based on wages you have earned from a public school employer (e.g., K-12, community college, etc.), a nonprofit educational employer (private school, college, etc.); or any nonprofit or public entity that provides services to or on behalf of a public or nonprofit educational employer. If you have enough non-educational wages in the base period of your claim to establish a valid claim, you may be able to receive benefits based on these wages during a recess period.\nWhen an award displays in this item, it means that in the base period of your claim there are wages that have been identified as being earned from both educational and non-educational employers. An award will ONLY display in this section if there are enough non-educational wages in the base period to establish a valid claim. (Refer to page 6 to determine what establishes a valid claim.) If this situation does not apply to you, it will state “This item does not apply to your claim.”\n\n• 8.

If you give false information or do not report information that you should report, you may be subject to disqualification and penalties.\n\n• 9. How to Stop Certifying for Benefits - If you want to discontinue certifying for unemployment benefits for any reason, and do not want to certify for benefits for the week(s) on the claim form, do not complete or mail the Continued Claim Form to the EDD, and do not certify using EDD Web-CertSM or EDD Tele-CertSM. Individuals may want to stop certifying for benefits because they have returned to work full time or because they have withdrawn from the labor market for personal reasons.",

How to Resume Certifying for Benefits - If you become unemployed or your hours are reduced, the easiest way to reopen your claim is online. Claims are reopened the Sunday of the week that you contact the EDD to file or reopen your claim. DO NOT delay reopening your claim. Your claim will not be reopened effective the date you last worked; the claim will be reopened the Sunday of the week you contact the EDD to reopen the claim. If the benefit date of your last UI claim has ended, you will need to file a new claim.\nPage 19 of 43",

    "content": "## The EDD Debit CardSM\n\nIn July 2011, Unemployment Insurance (UI) began issuing Visa branded EDD Debit CardsSM from Bank of America for electronic benefit payments, instead of mailing benefit checks. When your first electronic benefit payment is made, an EDD Debit CardSM will be mailed to you and you should receive it in no more than five business days from the date the payment is processed. Future benefits payments will be processed directly to your EDD Debit CardSM account, and you will have immediate access to your funds. You will receive information with the card about how to activate and use the card, about direct deposit transfer information, and contact information for Bank of America. A Continued Claim Form, without a check attached, will also be mailed to you after each electronic payment is processed. Once you receive your card, any UI Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits for which you are eligible will be deposited to the same card account during the three year life of the card. You will continue to certify benefits each week in the usual manner. Although the card is issued by Bank of America, you do not need to have a bank account with Bank of America, or with any bank, to use the card. DIRECT DEPOSIT TRANSFER: A direct deposit transfer gives you the option to transfer funds to your personal bank account from your EDD Debit CardSM. Direct deposit transfers must be initiated by you through Bank of America. You will be required to provide Bank of America with your e-mail address in order to do the transfer, so that they may notify you when the transfer is done. If you do not have an e-mail address, a direct deposit transfer cannot be done. You may request a direct deposit transfer of your funds one time, or you may request funds to be automatically transferred when each benefit payment is made. You can request all or part of your benefit payments to be transferred. Direct deposit transfers may take up to 48 hours to complete and funds will not be available for use until the transfer is completed. You are responsible for your EDD Debit CardSM activation and use. DO NOT SHARE your EDD Debit CardSM information with anyone or allow other people to use your card. The information sent to you with your card will advise you how to avoid fees with careful use of the card. WARNING: If you share your personal identification number (PIN) or you allow others to use your card, and you experience loss of benefits, the benefits will not be replaced. If your card is lost, stolen, damaged, or you believe it has been used fraudulently, you should contact Bank of America immediately. IMPORTANT: The EDD and Bank of America will NOT contact you under any circumstances to request your EDD Debit CardSM number and/or PIN. If you are contacted by phone or e-mail and asked for the information, DO NOT RESPOND.",

To serve the penalty weeks, you must mail in your Continued Claim Forms each week, and be otherwise eligible for each week claimed. When a new claim is filed or when an existing claim is reopened and there has been intervening work, you will be sent a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Claim Filed. The purpose of this form is to ensure the information you provided when the claim was filed is accurate. The EDD will consider the information correct, unless you report corrected information within ten (10) days from the mailing date of the form in writing, by phone, or online via Ask EDD on the EDD website. This will protect you from being assessed a false statement disqualification. Per Section 1263(a) of the UI Code, any individual convicted by any court under Section 2101 that willfully made false statements or knowingly failed to disclose a material fact to obtain or increase any benefit or payment, shall forfeit any rights to benefits for 52 weeks starting at the filing of the criminal complaint.

If you have general questions about overpayments or why you have been assessed an overpayment, you may call the UI toll-free telephone numbers listed on the inside cover of this handbook. The EDD classifies overpayments into two categories, non-fraud or fraud: Non-Fraud: When you have received benefits to which you were not entitled and you are not at fault, the overpayment is considered non-fraud. In some cases, the EDD can consider waiver of your non-fraud overpayment, and you may not have to repay the overpayment. You will receive a notice telling you if the overpayment must be repaid. Fraud: A fraud overpayment occurs when you knowingly give false information or withhold information and receive benefits that you should not have received. Withholding or giving false information to obtain unemployment insurance benefits is a serious offense that can result in criminal prosecution. With a fraud overpayment, you are assessed a penalty in the amount of 30 percent of the amount of the overpayment and a false statement disqualification of 5 to 23 weeks. Fraud overpayments and penalties must be repaid. If you do not repay your overpayment promptly, the EDD will deduct the money owed from your future weekly UI or State Disability Insurance",

The Standard Base Period is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the beginning date of the claim. The Alternate Base Period is the last four completed calendar quarters before the beginning date of the claim, which means that qualified individuals can potentially use more recently earned wages to file a UI claim. (For more information about the two different base periods, refer to Item 5, “Total Wages” on page 5 of this handbook.) For all individuals who contact the EDD to file a new UI claim, and who do not qualify to file a claim using the Standard Base Period, the EDD will automatically consider whether they potentially qualify to file a claim using the Alternate Base Period. The EDD may need specific employer and wage information from the individuals before being able to determine eligibility to file a claim using the Alternate Base Period. It is important that all individuals have their complete employment information for the past 18 months available when contacting the EDD to file a UI claim, including all employers’ names and complete mailing addresses. If individuals do not have the employers’ complete contact information, they may be asked to contact the EDD again when they have all the information available.

Employers issue DE 2063 forms to employees:\n\n• • Who are laid off for no more than two consecutive weeks, or\n• • Whose gross earnings, when reduced by $25 or 25 percent, whichever is greater, are less than their weekly benefit amount.\nWhen a new claim is filed or a claim is reopened, the EDD provides pre- addressed envelopes with the mailing address for completed DE 2063 forms. Failure to mail the completed DE 2063 to the correct address within 28 days of the form issue date may delay benefits. The DE 2063 form represents a seven-day period, usually based on the employer’s payroll week. Employees remain attached to the employer and do not have to look for other work, but must be able to work and be available for work. A Spanish translation is on the reverse side of the DE 2063. A Chinese translation of the DE 2063 is available on the EDD website www.edd.ca.gov. However, the English version of the form must be completed and submitted.",

    "content": "## Telephone Services\n\nMany EDD services can be accessed by telephone including recorded information about your most recent UI payment. The automated self-service number provides UI Benefit information and general information, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Unemployment Insurance payment information includes the date your last payment was issued, the amount paid, and period of time paid. To access your payment information, you will be asked to enter your SSN and a personal identification number (PIN) on your telephone keypad. You will establish your PIN the first time you use the self-service number to access your payment information. The EDD self-service number provides step-by-step instructions to guide you to services you want, in English and Spanish. For faster access to payment information or to certify for benefits using EDD Tele-CertSM, it is recommended that you call during non-business hours, after 5 p.m. and before 8 a.m., Monday through Friday, Pacific Standard Time, or on Saturday and Sunday. You will not be connected to a customer service representative using the self-service number. For more information about accessing payment information by telephone, refer to the EDD website at www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment. Under “Managing you UI Benefits,” select “Where is your UI Benefit Payment?” When you call one of the toll-free telephone numbers, customer service representatives are available to assist you with questions regarding missed appointments, appeals, overpayments, and UI claim Information, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Pacific Standard Time. Monday and Tuesday are usually our busiest days. For faster service, call us Wednesday or Thursday to file your claim or to inquire about your claim. You must, however, call by Friday of the week in which you become unemployed to receive credit for that week. Outside California: If you reside in another state and your UI benefit claim is against California (California is the state paying the benefits to you), the same telephone services as described above are available to you. For information on employment services in your state, you can call the America's Workforce Network Toll-Free Help Line at 1-877-US-2JOBS (1-877-872-5627) or visit their website at www.servicelocator.org. You can find the One-Stop Career Center nearest you, information on Unemployment Insurance for your state, and employment training. Remember that other states have different names for their employment services. In some states the local employment service may contact you directly about job registration and job search services. It may be mandatory that you register for work to receive unemployment benefits.",

This option is strictly voluntary; you are not required to have taxes withheld from your benefits. Some important points to consider when you make this choice:\n\n• • Unemployment compensation is subject to federal income tax. The EDD will report your benefits to the IRS annually.\n• • Requirements exist pertaining to estimated tax payments. Failure to pay required estimated income tax might result in federal income tax penalties.\n• • If you elect to have federal income taxes withheld, the adjusted weekly benefit amount is your weekly benefit amount minus deductions due to wages earned, illness, or certain other reasons.\nPage 43 of 43\nTHE GREAT SEAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EUREKA",
