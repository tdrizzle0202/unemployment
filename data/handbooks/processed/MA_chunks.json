The United States Department of Labor (USDOL) oversees the system, but each state administers its own program. The UI programs are paid for almost entirely by employer payroll contributions. Employees do not pay any part of the cost of UI Benefits.\nThe enactment of the Social Security Act of 1935 was the first major step towards establishing the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program in the United States. The UI system was created to stabilize the economy and assist unemployed workers who experience financial hardship after losing a job through no fault of their own. The Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA) administers the UI program in Massachusetts. Over the years, the program has undergone many changes, from monetary eligibility modifications and the establishment of special programs that provide additional weeks of benefits, to upgrades in technology to improve customer service. The program continues to change in order to support the needs of unemployed workers as they search for new employment.",

I am in the process of starting a new business as a sole proprietor but do not anticipate having any income from this business for a few months. I am currently receiving UI benefits. Would that affect my UI eligibility and benefits?\nEligibility for UI benefits is based on several factors. Among these is the requirement that you are able to work, available for work, and conduct an active search for work. If you are no longer available for other work or to conduct a search for work because of the demands of your own business, you may not be eligible for further benefits\n8.

Your claim is available until you exhaust all your benefits or until your benefit year has expired, whichever comes first.\n– 28 –\n10. I am not a US citizen.

Why was I paid?\nSometimes a payment is issued before a decision of eligibility is made if we are unable to resolve your issue in a timely manner. There is always a possibility with the Unemployment Insurance Program that you may be required to repay benefits you’ve received if it is later decided that you are not eligible.\n13. Why was I paid for some weeks but not others?\nSometimes there is more than one eligibility issue under review, or one issue can affect more than one week, but payment is not always released at the same time.\n14. Do I have to pay taxes on my UI benefits?\nYes. You are responsible for paying federal and state income taxes on your UI benefit.",

Do I need to continue child support payments while receiving UI benefits?\nIf DUA is advised by the Department of Revenue that child support payments have been ordered by the court, a child support deduction will be made from your UI benefits.\n16. My spouse and I were both laid off at the same time. Who should claim the child dependency allowance?\nYou cannot both claim the dependency allowance.
