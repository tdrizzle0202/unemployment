    "text": "1. Accurately Report the Reason You Are Unemployed. When you file your claim for benefits, provide the UI office with the exact reason for your separation so we can best determine your eligibility. Failure to report your work separation accurately may result in an overpayment and/or fraud penalties. 2. Report Any Monies You Earn. You must report all gross wages (before any deductions) in the week they are earned; regardless of when the wages will be paid. Failure to report earnings is considered fraud. Be sure to accurately report all work and earnings on your weekly claim certification – even those from self-employment, part-time, or temporary work. 3. Keep Your Information Current. The United States Postal Service will not forward UI Benefit Payments or other important UI related documentation. It is a requirement that you change your address when you relocate (even within the same city and state) and keep your telephone number and email address up to date. 4. Register With the Job Match System (JMS). If you live in New Hampshire, you must be registered for work in JMS unless specifically exempted by law. When filing your benefit application, a preliminary registration is automatically created. Access JMS at https://nhworksjobmatch.nhes.nh.gov/vosnet/Default.aspx to update your resume and look for jobs. If you do not live in New Hampshire, you must register for work with the state job service of your resident state. 5. Be Available and Actively Searching for Work. In order to collect benefits, you must continually verify that you are able, available and willing to accept suitable work. You must also search for work each week you file a claim for benefits. If you do not search for work during a week in which you file a claim, benefits may be denied. 6. Develop an Effective Work Search Plan. Contact a NH Local Office for help with creating a work search plan. Attend all mandatory employment service meetings you are scheduled for. 7. Avoid Errors and Ensure Proper Payment of Benefits. To prevent errors in payment of UI benefits that may result in an overpayment or underpayment, read all of the information provided to you and respond to all requests for information. 8. Don’t Delay – Report Your Return to Work. Be sure to report your hours and earnings on your weekly claim if you continue claiming benefits after you start a job. Do not wait until you receive your first paycheck to report your hours and earnings. If you have returned to work full time or are earning more than your weekly benefit amount, you can simply stop filing weekly claims. 9. Prevent Fraud. Anyone who collects UI benefits is legally responsible to know and follow the requirements set by State Law. Failure to follow the rules can result in serious consequences such as repaying benefits with penalties, forfeiting a future income tax refund, losing future eligibility to collect UI benefits, prosecution, and the possibility of jail. 10. Ask For Help. Navigating through the UI system can be confusing. If you have additional questions, please visit our website or contact your Local Office for assistance.",

    "text": "Q: Where do I find opportunities? A: Trainees can find their own Return To Work training opportunities with employers or they can use the Job Match System to identify opportunities. Look for opportunities from employers in new industries and /or those that provide new opportunities to utilize your transferable skills. Q: How do I get started? A: First, the trainee finds an employer that has the experience or uses the skill that they would like to develop. Attend a mandatory orientation. Approach the employer with the Employer Brochure. Both the employer and trainee complete an application for NHES authorization. Once the training opportunity is authorized, begin your up to six week training. Q: What skills can I obtain? A: The possibilities are endless! Obtain a new skill or integrate your current skills into a new industry. Be creative, this is a new opportunity. Q: Will I receive supervision? A: Yes, part of the employer’s agreement, and condition of NHES authorization, is that the employer will provide training and supervision. Q: How do I collect my benefit? A: Claimants can apply for UI compensation while in a pre-authorized training program. Claimants are subject to all the same eligibility requirements as those not participating in a training program. Claimants must remain eligible for unemployment compensation, continue to file for weekly benefits and continue an active job search. Work search logs shall be collected during the training period. Q: Are trainees guaranteed a job at the end of training? A: No, trainees are NOT guaranteed nor are they promised a potential job. The application for training includes an affidavit that the trainee must agree to acknowledge there is no guarantee or promise of a job from the training. However, the skills obtained or learned are transferable and can be beneficial in building a solid work history and resume. Q: Why should I participate? A: Return to Work is a win-win for both the employer and trainee. Trainees get a chance to develop new skills or learn how to use their existing skills in a new industry. Trainees get “a foot in the door” – the opportunity to show a potential employer their work ethic and fit with the workplace. Trainees who pursue these opportunities show a potential employer their skills and their interest in the employer’s company and that they are motivated to secure gainful employment. For more information contact your Local Office to sign up for an informational orientation.",
