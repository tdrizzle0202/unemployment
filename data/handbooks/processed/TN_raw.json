You may ﬁle a claim for beneﬁts the ﬁrst day after becoming separated from employment or after your employer has signiﬁcantly reduced your work hours. Information will be gathered from you as well as your separating employer and an agency determination will be based on whether you meet the eligibility requirements under state law. You must have earned an average of $780.01 in each of 2 quarters of a time frame called the Base Period, and the wages outside of the highest quarter are greater than or equal to the lesser of either $900 or 6 times the weekly beneﬁt amount. The total base period wages must be more than forty (40) times the weekly beneﬁt amount. If you’ve earned suﬃcient wages during this time frame, the wages earned will then be used to calculate your weekly beneﬁt amount and the number of weeks you may receive beneﬁts. The Base Period is the ﬁrst four of the last ﬁve completed calendar quarters prior to the quarter in which your initial claim is ﬁled. A calendar quarter is three months of either January through March, April through June, July through September, or October through December.",
